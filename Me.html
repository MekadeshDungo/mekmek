        <div id="moreInfo-1. The Modern English Phase" class="moreInfo">
        <h5>Theories of Language Acquisition</h5>
          <p>1. Behaviorism: This theory, proposed by B.F. Skinner, suggests that language is learned through imitation, reinforcement, and conditioning. For example, a child might learn to say "thank you" after receiving positive reinforcement for using the phrase correctly.<br><br>
            2. Innateness: This theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky, argues that children are born with an innate ability to learn language. For example, a child might naturally understand grammatical rules without explicit instruction.<br><br>
            3. Cognitive Theory: This theory posits that language acquisition is a part of overall cognitive development. For example, as a child's cognitive abilities develop, so does their understanding and use of language.<br><br>
            4. Interactionalist Theory: These theories suggest that language acquisition is influenced by both environmental interaction and innate capabilities. For example, a child might learn language through interactions with their parents, as well as their own cognitive development.

        <h5>Scope of Linguistics</h5><br>
        <p>1. Phonetics: The study of physical sounds in human speech. For example, the study of how the 'b' sound is produced.<br><br>
          2. Phonology: The study of how sounds function within a particular language. For example, the rules for combining sounds in English.<br><br>
          3. Morphology: The study of the internal structure of words. For example, understanding how adding 'un-' to 'happy' changes the meaning of the word.<br><br>
          4. Syntax: The study of how words combine to form sentences. For example, the rules for word order in a sentence.<br><br>
          5. Semantics: The study of meaning in language. For example, examining how the word 'love' can have different meanings in different contexts.<br><br>
          6. Pragmatics: The study of how context influences the interpretation of meaning. For example, understanding that the phrase "can you pass the salt?" is a request, not a question about ability.</p></div>

          <h5>Macro Linguistics</h5>
          <p>1. Sociolinguistics: The study of how language varies and changes in social groups. For
            example, studying how dialects vary between regions.<br><br>
            2. Psycholinguistics: The study of how language is processed in the brain. For example,
            studying how we understand ambiguous sentences.<br><br>
            3. Neurolinguistics: The study of how language is processed by the brain. For example, studying
            how damage to certain areas of the brain affects language ability.<br><br>
            4. Stylistics: The study of styles in languages. For example, analyzing the unique writing style of
            a particular author.<br><br>
            5. Discourse Analysis: The study of language in text and conversation. For example, analyzing a
            political speech to understand how language is used to persuade.<br><br>
            6. Computational Linguistics: The study of using computers to process human language. For
            example, developing algorithms for machine translation.<br><br>
            7. Cognitive Linguistics: The study of language as a part of our cognitive processes. For
            example, studying how our understanding of language influences our perception of the world.<br><br>
            8. Applied Linguistics: The application of linguistic theories, principles, and methods to solve
            real-world problems. For example, language teaching, translation, and language policy.</p></div>

            <H5>2 Types of Grammar</H5>
            <p>1. Descriptive Grammar: This refers to the structure of a language as it is actually used by
              speakers and writers. For example, using "ain't" in informal conversation.<br><br>
              2. Prescriptive Grammar: This refers to the explicit rules and structures of language as defined
              by grammar books and language usage guides. For example, the rule that a sentence should not
              end with a preposition.</p></div><br><br></center>
              <h5>SEMANTICS</h5>
              <p>● Semantics is the study of meaning that is used to understand human expression through
                language. It is also a branch of linguistics that is concerned with studying how meaning
                is constructed and communicated in written or spoken language.</p>

                <h5>CONNOTATION AND DENOTATION MEANING</h5>
                <p><b>DENOTATION</b> (Direct Expression)<br>
                  A word's denotative meaning is its main meaning, excluding any emotions or concepts that
                  individuals may associate with it. It is a phrase or expression’s clear and straightforward
                  meaning.<br>Example: "Home" (a place to stay, a house)</p>
                <p><b>CONNOTATION</b> (Indirect Expression)<br>It is an additional meaning to a word or term beyond its evident or simple meaning. Connotation
                  is the act of giving a word or expression a meaning other than its literal meaning.
                  Example: "Home" (a place of warmth, comfort, and affection) “Home is a person”</p></div>

                  <h5>WORD AND SENTENCES MEANING</h5>
                  <p><b>2 TYPES OF MEANING</b><br><br>
                  <b>CONCEPTUAL MEANING</b><br>
                  It is the simple, literal definition of the word from a dictionary, with no deeper meaning
                  conveyed or implication.<br>Example: “Sweet” (having the pleasant taste characteristic) “The honey tastes to sweet”
                <br><br><b>ASSOCIATIVE MEANING</b><br>An associative meaning has to do with the individual’s emotions/feelings or understanding of
                the word. It refers to the certain characteristics or traits that go beyond the literal meaning that
                people frequently associate with a word or phrase, whether that connection is accurate or not.
                Example: “Sweet” (kind and gentle towards other people) “My mother is so sweet when it comes
                to children”</p></div><br><br></center>
                <h5>SEMANTICS FEATURES</h5><p>Semantic Features are theoretical units of meaning-holding components which are used for
                  representing word meaning. It helps us finding the right noun in to the sentence and are
                  established by contrast and can be stated in terms of (+) or (-)</p>

              <p><b>SEMANTICS ROLES</b><br>also known as thematic roles or theta roles. It is a role that the arguments (subject, object) play in
                a sentence.</p>

                <div id="moreInfo-Types of Semantics Roles" class="moreInfo">
              <p><b>Types of Semantics Roles</b><br><b>1. Agent</b> <center>- is the semantic role of a person or thing who is the doer of an event.</center><br>Example:<br>
                “Angela was bitten by the dog", Angela is the subject, dog is the agent.
                “Paul was chased by the flying cockroach”</p>
              <p><b>2. Goal</b><center>- is the entity from which the action of the verb originates. It is the place where
                something move something towards which an action is directed.</center><br>Example:<br>
                “He threw the book at me”, "threw" is the verb, “at me” is the direction.<br>
                “Paul swam to the left part of the pool.”</p>
              <p><b>3. Source</b><center>- The place of origin. Indicates the place or object where the movement expressed by the
                verb starts.</center><br>Example:<br>“Paul received the books from Jean”
                <br>“Jani picked up the pen from the box”</p>
              <p><b>4 . Theme</b><center>- The entity that is moved by the action or event denoted by the predicate.</center><br>Example:<br>
                “Mary kicked the ball”</p>
              <p><b>5. Beneficiary</b><center>- For “whose” benefit action was performed.</center><br>Example:<br>“Fiona bought a necklace for Clyde”<br>“I gave the bracelet to Airah for Darlyn”</p>
              <p><b>6. Location</b><center>- is a semantic role which identifies the location or spatial orientation of a state or action.
                A locative semantic role does not imply motion to, from, or across the location.</center><br>Example:<br>“The paper is in the bag”<br>“Zaira went to Canada last month”</p>
              <p><b>7. Time</b><center>- is the semantic role of the temporal placement of an event.</center>Example:<br>“The class will end at 1 pm.”<br>“Paul will have a date on Sunday”</p>
              <p><b>8. Manner</b><center>- is a semantic role that notes how the action, experience, or process of an event is
                carried out.</center><br>Example:<br>“Darlyn walked to school slowly”<br>“It rained heavily last night”</p>
              <p><b>9. Instrument</b><center>- The agent used to implement the event. It is the stimulus or immediate physical cause of
                an event.</center><br>Example:<br>“Paul was dragged by his horse for several meters” horse is the instrument.</p>
              <p><b>10. Experiencer</b><center>- The living entity that experiences the action or event.</center><br>Example:<br>“Aly felt cold.”<br>“Bea was scared”</p></div><br><br></center>
              <h5>LEXICAL RELATIONS</h5>
<p>It is the study of how lexicons are managed and how the lexical meanings of lexical items
interact with one another. It describes the relationships between the meanings of words. They are
one of the ways of understanding the meaning of words.<br>
<center><br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('Types of Lexical Relations')">Types of Lexical Relations</button>
<div id="moreInfo-Types of Lexical Relations" class="moreInfo">
<b>Types of Lexical Relations</b><br>
<b>1. Synonymy</b><br>
<center>- refers to a word with the same or that has a closely related meaning.</center><br>
Example:<br> • Pretty - Beautiful • Big - Large<br><br>
<b>2. Antonymy</b><br>
<center>- a pair of words with opposite meanings.</center><br>
Example:<br> • Poor - Rich • Big - Small<br><br>
<b>3. Hyponymy</b><br>
<center>- the lexical relation described in English by the phrase kind/type/sort of. It includes the
meaning of a more general word.</center><br>
Example:<br>
“Green, Blue, Red” is the hyponyms of ‘color’<br>
“1, 3, 5, 7, 9 11…” is the hyponyms of ‘odd number’<br><br>
<b>4. Prototypes</b><br>
<center>- A member or a set of members of a group that best represent the group as a whole.</center><br>
Example:<br> Chair is the prototype of ‘furniture’<br><br>
<b>5. Homophones</b><br>
<center>- words that sound the same but with different spelling and meaning.</center><br>
Example:<br> • know - no • ice - eyes • eight - ate<br><br>
<b>6. Homonyms</b><br>
<center>- words with same spelling and pronunciation but with different meanings</center><br>
Example:<br> • Right (correct) Right (direction) • Row (to paddle) Row (sets of people of things)<br><br>
<b>7. Polysemy</b><br>
<center>- several meanings of the word seem to be derived from one another.</center><br>
Example: “BAR”<br>
“We went to BAR last night”<br>
“ I have to study for the BAR”<br>
“I have a chocolate BAR </p></div>

<div id="moreInfo-PHRASAL / SENTENTIAL SEMANTICS" class="moreInfo">
<h5>PHRASAL / SENTENTIAL SEMANTICS</h5>
<p>• The meaning of syntactic units larger than words such as phrases and sentences.<br>
  • Verbs and a particle and/or a preposition co-occur forming a single semantic unit.<br><br>

  Example:<br><br>• “win over” to win • “act out” to perform</p>             
<p><b>COLLOCATION</b><br>Collocation is a word or phrase that is often used in another word or phrase, in a way that sounds
  correct to people who have spoken the language all their lives.
  Collocations are words that naturally go together.<br>
  Example:<br>
  Fast food (✅) Quick food (❌)<br>
  Super-fast train (✅) Quick train (❌)<br>
  Take a photo (✅) Make a photo (❌)</p></div><br>

<P><b>THE THREE CIRCLES OF ENGLISH</b><br>
  The "Three Circles of English" is a model proposed by linguist Braj Kachru to represent the<br>
  global spread and use of the English language. This model categorizes English into three<br>
  concentric circles, each reflecting different patterns of language use. The three circles are the<br>
  Inner Circle, Outer Circle, and Expanding Circle.<br>
<center><br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('Inner Circle')">Inner Circle</button>
  <div id="moreInfo-Inner Circle" class="moreInfo">
  1. Inner Circle:<br>
  • Countries: Native English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, the United<br>
  States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.<br>
  • Role: English in these countries is the first language used as a native language in various<br>
  domains of life, including education, government, media, and everyday communication.<br></div>
  <br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('Outer Circle')">Outer Circle</button>
  <div id="moreInfo-Outer Circle" class="moreInfo">
  2. Outer Circle:<br>
  • Countries: Countries where English plays a significant role as a second language.<br>
  Examples include India, Singapore, Nigeria, and South Africa.<br>
  • Role: English in these countries is often used as a second language and has official or<br>
  institutional status. It is used alongside indigenous languages in education, government, and<br>
  other formal contexts.<br></div><br>
  <br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('Expanding Circle')">Expanding Circle</button>
  <div id="moreInfo-Expanding Circle" class="moreInfo">
  3. Expanding Circle:<br>
  • Countries: Countries where English is learned as a foreign language. This circle includes<br>
  countries in Asia, Europe, and other regions where English is not a native or official language.<br>
  • Role: English in these countries is typically learned for international communication,<br>
  business, science, and technology. It may not have official status but is used as a tool for global<br>
  interaction.<br>
  Kachru's model acknowledges the diverse ways in which English is used worldwide and<br>
  emphasizes that English functions as a global language with different varieties and functions in<br>
  different contexts. The model is not meant to imply a hierarchy of languages but rather to<br>
  recognize the dynamic and evolving nature of English as it spreads and adapts in various<br>
  linguistic and cultural settings.<br></P></div><br>

  <p><b>EXAMPLE:</b>
  <b>1. Inner Circle:</b><br>
    • Country: United States<br>
    • Example: English is the native language, and it is used in all domains of life. For<br>
    instance, in the U.S., English is the language of education, government, media, and daily
    communication.<br>
  <b>2. Outer Circle:</b><br>
    • Country: India<br>
    • Example: In India, English has an official and institutional status. It is used in education,
    administration, and business, alongside numerous indigenous languages. English is often a
    second language for many Indians.<br>
  <b> 3. Expanding Circle:</b><br>
    • Country: China<br>
    • Example: In China, English is learned as a foreign language and is not an official<br>
    language. However, it is widely studied for international communication, trade, and education.
    English is a tool for global interaction in various domains.
    These examples demonstrate how English is used in different ways across the three circles,
    reflecting its status as a global language with diverse varieties and functions. The Inner Circle
    represents native English-speaking countries, the Outer Circle includes countries where English
    has institutional status, and the Expanding Circle comprises regions where English is learned as a
    foreign language for international communication.</p></div><br><br></center>

<p><h5><b>THE EVOLUTION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE</b></h5>
  The English language has changed significantly over the ages, starting with Old English in the
  early Middle Ages and ending with the Modern language we speak today. Several factors, such
  as historical events, changes in culture, and advancements in technology have impacted that
  shift.<br><br>
  <b>PHASES ON THE EVOLUTION OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE</b><br>
     - Every phase is distinguished by distinctive influences and resulting changes to the
  vocabulary, syntax, grammar, and pronunciation of the language.</p><center>
  <br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('1')">1. The Anglo Saxon Phase (Old English)</button>
  <div id="1" class="moreInfo">
<p><b>1. The Anglo Saxon Phase (Old English)</b><br>
  - This phase refers to the early period of the English language, spanning roughly from the
  5th century to the 11th century.<br>
  - Angle, member of a Germanic people, which, together with the Jutes, Saxons, and
  probably the Frisians, invaded the island of Britain in the 5th century CE.<br>
  - The Proto-English spoken by the Angles and Saxons evolved into Old English over
  time. Old English gained a written form as a result of the rise of a new religious class
  who needed to read and write in order to understand and teach the Bible.<br>
  - Old English gradually replaced the old Latin and Celtic(Scottish) influences in England,
  which are surprisingly not present from modern English—very few English place names
  or personal names have Latin or Celtic ancestry.<br>
  - The Angles and Saxons brought their North Sea Germanic dialects to their new
  home, and the linguistic connections between English and the dialects spoken in
  Northern Germany can still be found today. They even gave their name to the new
  country—Angle-land, or England.<br>
  - Old English may seem foreign, but there are certain structural and syntactical similarities
  between it and the modern language that we speak and write. Only about 1% of our
  vocabulary can be traced back to Old English, despite the fact that following linguistic
  waves over the British Isles displaced much of it. However, Old English is still the
  source of some of our most basic words, especially those that are related to
  families—man, wife, child, brother, and sister, to mention a few.<br>
  - The latest round of invasions and colonization hit the British Isles between the eighth and
  tenth centuries CE. Danelaw's linguistic mark is still evident in England today since the
  Viking invaders introduced new borrowings from the Old Norse Language. Words that
  have substantial meanings such as husband, sky, and leg have Viking origins.<br>
  - The addition of Scandinavian words to Old English also increased its flexibility, as new
  terms generally enhanced rather than entirely replaced pre-existing vocabulary. Because
  of this, Old English had a large number of synonyms and duplicates that permitted
  different words to convey slightly different concepts. Old Norse's grammar and syntax
  were also incorporated into Old English.</p></div><br>
  <br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('2. The Middle English Phase')">2. The Middle English Phase</button>
  <div id="moreInfo-2. The Middle English Phase" class="moreInfo">
<p><b>2. The Middle English Phase</b><br>
  - The Norman king William I destroyed the Anglo-Saxon ruling class when he
  invaded England in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, bringing in the second phase of
  the English language's history.<br>
  - Originally from Normandy in Northern France, the Normans were descended from
  Vikings. Unlike the earlier Saxon and Viking invasions, there was no large-scale
  migration during the invasion of Normandy. The vast majority of English speakers
  continued to live and speak normally, but it was actually the replacement of one
  class of elites by another—the Old English nobility had been wiped out and replaced
  by a new Anglo-Norman ruling class.<br>
  - Norman French, not English, became the official language of the English ruling class
  for decades following the Norman Conquest; from 1066 until Henry IV's coronation in
  1399, no English king spoke English as their first language. The words that were brought
  over from Norman French into modern English clearly illustrate this linguistic and social
  division.<br>
  - Many of the characteristics that make English so identifiable today were formed
  during this period, such as uninflected verbs with stable consonants (inflection is the
  changing of a word's structure, usually its ending, to reflect various factors such as
  gender, mood, and tense). Despite all of these settings, verb tenses and other parts of
  speech in English tend to be the same. These innovations were to prove incredibly
  beneficial to English as it spread over the world, as we discover presently.</p></div>
  <br><br><button onclick="showMoreInfo('3. The Modern English Phase')">3. The Modern English Phase</button>
  <div id="moreInfo-3. The Modern English Phase" class="moreInfo">
    <P><b>3. The Modern English Phase</b><br>
      - The Modern English phase extends from the 16th century to the present day. Perhaps the
      biggest change during this phase was the culmination of the revolution of the
      phonology of English (the Great Vowel Shift), running roughly from 1400-1600 CE,
      when vowels started to move toward the front of English speakers' mouths. For instance,
      in the time of Shakespeare, the word "life" was pronounced "lafe," with the vowel
      positioned more deeply in the throat.<br>
      - English started to be recognized for its literary potential at this point. Shakespeare was
      the only author to fully utilize the extraordinary flexibility and complexity of the
      English language.<br>
      - However, for a large portion of the history of the English language's evolution, terms
      avoided regular transcription; Shakespeare, for example, gave his words a confusing
      variety of inconsistent spellings across his works. Only with the development of the
      printing press in the fifteenth century and the following widespread utilization of spread
      of written works (and thus, literacy) throughout England.<br>
      - More titles than ever previously were available in English by 1640, with over 20,000
      available at that time. Local spelling differences growing gave rise to London spelling
      patterns as printed works produced by London printers became more widely distributed
      throughout the nation. This also meant that, in addition to many word pronunciations
      changing due to the Great Vowel Shift, earlier spellings became permanent. Many
      terms in the written language that has been passed down to us are spelled exactly as
      they were spoken 400 years ago.<br>
      - Because of this, both non-native English speakers and people who have spoken the
      language their entire lives have difficulty with spelling. Spelling and pronunciation
      often differ from one another. For instance, the sound sh can be spelled sh in “mashing"
      or ti in “ration” or ss, for "session." The problematic English spelling, or writing
      standards, can be observed in terms like debt, know, knead, and colonel, which have both
      silent and hidden but pronounced letters.</P></center>
